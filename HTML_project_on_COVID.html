    <h2> 3.<strong style="border: 4px solid yellow"> HOW DID IT ORIGINATE ?</strong> </h2>
   <p> Many health experts believe that the new strain of coronavirus likely originated in bats or pangolins. The first transmission to humans was in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has mostly spread through person-to-person contact. <br/>

   Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause disease in both animals and humans. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus strain known as SARS-CoV is an example of a coronavirus. SARS spread rapidly in 2002–2003.<br/>

   The new strain of coronavirus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).</br> 
   The recent outbreak began in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province of China. Reports of the first COVID-19 cases started in December 2019.

<strong> W.H.O. VIEWS ON CORONA VIRUS </strong>
<p> <li><mark >Advice for public </mark></li>
Coronavirus disease is an infectioius disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
<br/>Most people infected with the covid-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those woth underlying medical problems like cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes,chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
<br/> The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the CoVID-19 virus,the disease
it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub 
frequently and not touching your face. <br/>
The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes,
so it's important that you also practice respiratoru etiquette (by coughing into a flexed elbow).
<br/> 
<mark>STAY INFORMED </mark>
